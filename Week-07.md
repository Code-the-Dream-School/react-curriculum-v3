# Week-07

## Introduction

### Topics Covered

- Data Fetching
- UI Update Strategies

### Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, we will:

#### Objective 1: Data Fetching

- Discuss data fetching in React applications to send and receive data
- Implement data fetching to retrieve and save data to manage application state

#### Objective 3: UI Update Strategies

- Examine pessimistic and optimistic UI update strategies related to how they impact a user's experience
- Implement an optimistic UI update strategy and handle failure scenarios where we need to revert changes

## Discussion Topics

### Data Fetching

- fetch used to work with APIs -CRUD
	- pull in data to display
	- create and update data outside application
	- delete remote data
- async keyword used so that we can work with promise objects
- allows application to continue processing while awaiting a response
- once the promise settles, it returns the data will be transformed and introduced into the application
- An API error, network outage, or other interruption may cause the fetch to fail - we need to handle these
	- wrap in try/catch block

### Conditional Rendering

- may not want to show an element at all times
	- list may be empty - no items should render
	- item sold out - shouldn't appear in the store for sale
	- user not logged in - shouldn't show a link to get to an account
- ternary operator can show an either or
	- In React, putting null in the `or` portion will render into nothing
- boolean state variable, `isLoading`
- derive state where possible to avoid "impossible state"
	- too many useStates make managing state error-prone

### UI Update Strategies

> [!note]
> We will not be discussing `useOptimistic` hook. At the time of this writing, this feature exists only in the [canary](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/canary-canary-testing) version of React so is not suitable for normal use.

- interfaces rely on information changes to update their interface
- pessimistic - updates only after network operation completes
	- accurately reflects of state in a system - only displays changes after a successful server operation
		- servers will send persisted data back with the success response - this is the data that is added to React's state, not direct user input
	- simpler to code - no need for reversions in case of server or network errors
	- feels sluggish to users even on fast internet connections
- optimistic - updates immediately while network operation is still underway
	- sacrifices state accuracy to give the user a faster experience
	- user changes shown immediately
		- data updated in the background with the server's response
	- more complex to program than pessimistic
		- must manage a fallback state in case operation fails
		- UI should indicate when a display is transitional data
			- grayed out or italicized text
			- spinners
			- autosave success [toast](https://uxpickle.com/what-is-a-toast-notification/) messages
		- messaging must be clear to explain change reversions
			- error handling
		- optionally save transmitted data for recovery after failure (repopulate form fields so users don't have to do it again)
